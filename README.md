# Regression with TensorFlow

## Overview
Explore the capabilities of machine learning in predicting insurance costs with our TensorFlow-based regression model. This project showcases the practical application of regression analysis in the insurance sector, using TensorFlow to predict customer insurance costs based on various factors.

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses TensorFlow to build regression models predicting insurance costs.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Includes Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the model building and evaluation process.

## Project Structure
- **Insurance_with_Tensorflow.ipynb**: Demonstrates the initial model building steps.
- **Predict_Insurance_Cost_For_Customer_Based_on_Their_Situation.ipynb**: Applies the model to predict insurance costs for specific customer scenarios.
- **Regression_With_TensorFlow_01.ipynb**: Further explores model refinement and tuning.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**: Secure a local copy of the project to get started.
2. **Set up your environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
    .\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
